\arguments{
\item{dir}{String containing the directory where the MCMC files are located}

\item{n_files}{Int containing the number of files per parameter}

\item{time}{Vector containing time points of interest}

\item{X}{Matrix containing covariates at points of interest (of dimension N x D (number of points of interest x number of covariates))}

\item{basis_degree}{Int containing the degree of B-splines used}

\item{boundary_knots}{Vector containing the boundary points of our index domain of interest}

\item{internal_knots}{Vector location of internal knots for B-splines}

\item{k}{Int containing the cluster group of which you want to get the credible interval for}

\item{alpha}{Double specifying the percentile of the credible interval ((1 - alpha) * 100 percent)}

\item{rescale}{Boolean indicating whether or not we should rescale the Z variables so that there is at least one observation almost completely in one group}

\item{simultaneous}{Boolean indicating whether or not the credible intervals should be simultaneous credible intervals or pointwise credible intervals}

\item{burnin_prop}{Double containing proportion of MCMC samples to discard}
}
\value{
CI list containing the credible interval for the mean function, as well as the median posterior estimate of the mean function. Posterior samples fo the mean function are also returned.
}
\description{
This function calculates a credible interval with the user specified coverage
in a covariate adjusted model. The function returns the estimated mean functions
at the specified value of covariates (specified in 'X').
In order to run this function, the directory of the posterior samples needs
to be specified. The function will return the credible intervals and the median
posterior estimate of the mean function at the time points specified by the
user (\code{time} variable) and the covariate value specified (\code{x_i} variable).
The user can specify if they would like the algorithm
to automatically rescale the parameters for interpretability (suggested). If
the user chooses to rescale, then all class memberships will be rescaled so
that at least one observation is in only one class. The user can also specify
if they want pointwise credible intervals or simultaneous credible intervals.
The simultaneous intervals will likely be wider than the pointwise credible
intervals.
}
\section{Warning}{

The following must be true:
\describe{
  \item{\code{X}}{must have the same number of columns as covariates in the model (D)}
  \item{\code{n_files}}{must be an integer larger than or equal to 1}
  \item{\code{basis_degree}}{must be an integer larger than or equal to 1}
  \item{\code{internal_knots}}{must lie in the range of \code{boundary_knots}}
  \item{\code{k}}{must be an integer larger than 1 and less than or equal to the number of clusters in the model}
  \item{\code{alpha}}{must be between 0 and 1}
  \item{\code{burnin_prop}}{must be less than 1 and greater than or equal to 0}
